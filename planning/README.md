# planning

We created and edited this file:
  1. AR_tag_pathtest.py

This package handles the path planning for the Sawyer arm. With the hand attached we needed some predetermined offsets since the planner would move the right cuff of the Sawyer
to the AR tag since we wanted the chopsticks to be at the specified position. Thus we made it so that we can pass in different offsets at the terminal depending on the goal.

Alex, Michelle, Suphakorn, Aryaman contributed to this package.
