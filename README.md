We cloned these repositories:
1. https://github.com/zihunkye/allegro_hand_ros_kinetic_v4
2. https://github.com/ros-perception/ar_track_alvar

To use simply clone all the packages into your workspace, along with the Allegro_hand package linked above. You will have to replace the two torque_control nodes in the package with the ones found in
group_work, but after that you should be good to go.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
